Concordia could always use more documentation. If you have worked with the tool and found any of our documentation to be inaccurate or vague, please submit an issue or a pull request.

If you are proposing a feature:

## Contributing Changes

If you have work which you would like to share with the main project, GitHub has
a [guide for creating pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
as part of their broader help site, which also includes instructions for performing
common tasks using the Git command-line interface or various desktop interfaces.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. You should be able and willing to release your code under the same terms as
   the top-level LICENSE file
1. The pull request should include tests.
1. If the pull request adds functionality it should be described at a technical
   level in the code and user-visible changes should be described in the
   main README
